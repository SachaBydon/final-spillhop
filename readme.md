## Presentation of the story
On 17 May 2540, the ATOM cargo ship under the command of the autonomous robotic unit ERP-6750 found itself sucked into the black hole TON 618 following a technical failure of its vessel.  

You are ERP-6750, an autonomous robotic unit ready to do anything to bring back the information you discovered at the bottom of the black hole.  

Indeed, a strange civilisation seems to have managed to survive at the bottom of the black hole and thanks to a teleport network you may have a chance to get out of it and return home with crucial informations for your civilisation.
